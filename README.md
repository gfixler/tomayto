# Tomayto

Tomayto is an ongoing research project into using a key-press-based state machine as the primary means of operating Maya.

## Status

The system creates a new, temporary hotkey map that redirects every key press/release combo possible in Maya through a state machine, with a stack of states, which allows for very complex, rapid control of Maya, far faster, and with far more power, than mouse, menus, context menus, or even custom hotkeys, or tooling allow. It also provides a framework for playing with an endless number of novel ideas, such as hiding all of a type of thing only while a particular chord is held down, fast camera work, rapid UI creation, a large number of new selection and interaction models, Vim-like text manipulation (even directly on buttons and window titlebars), and even stack-based operations, which opens a whole new world of RPN-style calculation and interaction. Much of this is spec'd out, in part or in whole, some of it implemented, but overall, work is ongoing. This is very pre-alpha, but early results are exciting.
